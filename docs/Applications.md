## [](#header-2)Applications

Below, we present few examples where we used the LBSA and its features to show the versatility of the presented software.



1) Adaptive optics / beam correction 
The LBSA correction and transformation features are the outcome of our work [1](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2019.01.014), where we proposed the objective criteria to evaluate the quality of the laser beam. For this purpose we firstly corrected the beam using the combined correction algorithms: SLM surface correction and the iterative G-S correction based on the optical vortex image. Based on these results we evaluated the beam through the exploration of the vortex trajectory - movement of the vortex point caused by the shift of its generating element. In this case, the vortex was generated by the SLM and such movement was controlled through the translation of the hologram.



2) Fiber modes excitation
In [2](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.422736) we used the software to selectively excite higher-modes in optical fibers. The purpose of this was to measure the chromatic dispersion in single mode optical fibers, which enables dispersion measurements in higher-order modes over a wide spectral range. The examplary image presents few of the excited modes without (left) and with (right) filter, to show the wide spectral range of the excited mode.
