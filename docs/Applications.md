## [](#header-2)Applications

Below, we present few examples where we used the LBSA and its features to show the versatility of the presented software.



1) Adaptive optics / beam correction 



2) Fiber modes excitation
In [1](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.422736) we used the software to selectively excite higher-modes in optical fibers. The purpose of this was to measure the chromatic dispersion in single mode optical fibers, which enables dispersion measurements in higher-order modes over a wide spectral range. The examplary
