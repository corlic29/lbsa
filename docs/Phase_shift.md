This function is responsible for the generation of a constant phase shift (plane wave). 
User can specify the phase shift amount in degrees and the final phase shift 
is simultaneously represented in both degrees and radians ('x' Ï€).

As an example, the optical vortex has been shifted by 90 degrees, which rotated the vortex map accordingly.
