This tutorial provides support for the Laser Beam Shaping Application that operates the Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) together with the external camera, to shape the laser beam. The application works as a complex unit that allows the user to use all of its features within a single application, run through MATLAB software.

To operate, it requires a MATLAB R2020a or newer with an active Image Acquisition Toolbox and optional Add-ons that enable MATLAB â€“ camera communication. 

The application is divided into two sections. The left section stands as an operating/control one, allowing the user to see what features are currently implemented and what kind of hologram is currently displayed. The right section is responsible for the modification of hologram parameters as well as for operating the beam correction algorithms.
