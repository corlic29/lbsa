This tutorial provides support for the Laser Beam Shaping Application that operates the Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) together with the external camera, to shape the laser beam. The application works as a complex unit that allows the user to use all of its features within a single application, run through MATLAB software.

To operate, it requires a MATLAB R2020a or newer with an active Image Acquisition Toolbox and optional Add-ons that enable MATLAB – camera communication. 

The application is divided into two sections. The left section stands as an operating/control one, allowing the user to see what features are currently implemented and what kind of hologram is currently displayed. The right section is responsible for the modification of hologram parameters as well as for operating the beam correction algorithms. 

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!
